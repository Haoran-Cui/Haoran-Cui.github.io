## Research Interests

- Smart product-service system design
- Personalized recommendation
- Artificial intelligence
- Knowledge management

My research work is in the area of Smart Product-service System (SPSS) Design, one of the import subareas of Design Science. SPSS conceptual design could be regarded as combination problems in the three-dimensional space composed of context/stakeholders, product and service. It has been focused on personalized recommendation (e.g. service recommendation, solution recommendation, product-service transfer), requirement engineering (e.g. requirement acquisition, requirement quantification, context-driven design), lifecycle implements (e.g. redesign, sustainable design, design optimization) with relevant methods in: 1) design informatics; 2) artificial intelligence; 3) complex network; 4) knowledge management.
